# ICT-LAB Portfolio

Steps to succesfully run project on local environment:
1.  clone repo
2.  in main directory run command "yarn install"
3.  in main directory run command "composer install"
4.  create local environment with your prefered application, I use valet+.(call local environment ict-lab.test or rename it in the wp-config-local.php)
5.  info about local environment can be found in the wp-config-local.php
6.  run the command "yarn run build".(this will compile all the src files).
